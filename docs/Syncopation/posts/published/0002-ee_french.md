# How to Apply for PR via Learning French and Express Entry
This blog explains how to apply for permanent residence (PR) in Canada through the Express Entry system by leveraging French-language proficiency category. We will begin with a brief overview of the Express Entry system, and then focus on the eligibility criteria for the <span style="color: red;">**Canadian Experience Class**</span> program and the <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span> category.

**TL;DR:** 

1. Check your [eligibility for the Express Entry System](#star-eligibility-for-immigration-programs). 
2. [Calculate your CRS score](#comprehensive-ranking-system-crs) and compare it with the [cutoff scores for the French-language proficiency category in recent rounds](#star-information-of-french-language-proficiency-category-in-recent-round). 
3. If your score is competitive, you can begin preparing for the French-language proficiency test to meet the [minimum criteria for French-language proficiency category](#star-french-language-proficiency-category-eligibility).

## Overview
[TOC]
## Brief Introduction of Express Entry
[Express Entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry) is the Canadian government's online system for managing skilled worker immigration. In this guide, we will use `EE Entry` to refer to the Express Entry system.

EE Entry is a score-based system with different immigration programs and selection categories. Understanding both is critical to maximizing your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. In this section, we briefly introduce the Canadian Experience Class and the French-language proficiency category. For more details, see [EE Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply.html#programs).

There are three main structural components of EE Entry:

1. <span style="color: red;">**Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)**</span>: Calculate your CRS score, which is not only used in eligibility but also used in ranking.
2. <span style="color: red;">**Immigration Programs**</span>: Determine your eligibility to enter the EE pool.
3. <span style="color: red;">**Current Categories**</span>: Award additional points in targeted rounds or encourage more applications by requiring lower scores.

To begin, you must first qualify for one of the immigration programs, then explore categories to boost your score.

## Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)
CRS Score System is a key component of EE Entry. It is used to determine candidates' eligibility and rank them in the pool. Here is the [official calculator](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/check-score.html#calculator). <span style="color: red;">**Generally, young people with relatively good educational backgrounds can easily earn CRS points sufficient to pass the French-language proficiency category.**</span>

## Eligibility for EE Entry and the Three `Immigration programs`
### Immigration Programs
According to the [official website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry), EE Entry includes three immigration programs:

1. Canadian Experience Class
2. Federal Skilled Worker Program
3. Federal Skilled Trades Program<br><br>

### 🚀 $\star$ Eligibility for Immigration Programs
Each program has distinct eligibility requirements. Applicants must first identify the one they qualify for to enter the EE pool.

We'll focus on the [Canadian Experience Class](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/who-can-apply/canadian-experience-class.html):

1. Be in one or more NOC categories: <span style="color: red;">**TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3**</span>
    1. Your experience can be in more than one NOC.
    2. See explanation of NOC in the [Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class](#explanation-of-the-eligibility-of-canadian-experience-class) section.
2. Be <span style="color: red;">**gained in Canada**</span> while authorized to work under temporary resident status
    1. If you worked remotely, you must have been physically in Canada and working for a Canadian employer.
3. Show that you performed:
    1. The actions in the lead statement of the NOC job description
    2. Most of the main duties listed
4. Be <span style="color: red;">**paid work**</span> (you must have been paid wages or earned commission—volunteer work or unpaid internships don't count)
5. Be at least 1 year of work or 1,560 hours total (30 hours per week) in the 3 years before you apply<br><br>



### Explanation of the Eligibility of Canadian Experience Class
#### What is NOC and TEER?
The National Occupation Classification (NOC) system is used by Canada to classify occupations. The updated NOC uses <span style="color: red;">**Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER)**</span> levels.
Only TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 jobs count toward the Canadian Experience Class.<br><br>

#### How to Check Your TEER Level?
1. Use the [Find your NOC tool](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/find-national-occupation-code.html) to search your job title.
2. Cross-reference the NOC code in the [official NOC website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) to verify job duties.
3. If it matches and falls under TEER 0–3, congratulations! You're eligible for CEC.<br><br>

#### Example of NOC and TEER

Take an example of a Graduate Student in Canada, the NOC code of `Post-secondary teaching and research assistants` is `41201` with `TEER 1` level, as we can see in the [NOC Website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA). 

We can then see in the [Search Result of NOC Website](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NOCProfile?code=41201&version=2021.0), Both Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants are included in TEER 1. So if you were serving as a TA or RA in Canada for at least 1 year, you are eligible for Canadian Experience Class Program.<br><br>

## `Current Categories`
### All Current Categories
Once you're eligible for one of the three programs, you can increase your CRS score through the following six `Current categories`:

1. <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span>
2. Healthcare and social services occupations  
3. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations  
4. Trade occupations  
5. Agriculture and agri-food occupations  
6. Education occupations

This guide focuses on the <span style="color: red;">**French-language proficiency**</span> category.<br><br>

### 🚀 $\star$ French-language proficiency Category Eligibility
1. <span style="color: red;">**Meet the minimum criteria for Express Entry**</span>, including being eligible for 1 of the 3 immigration programs it covers
2. Have French-language test results that show a minimum score of <span style="color: red;">**7 in all 4 language abilities**</span> on the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens
      1. The equivalency between TCFCanada and NCLC is shown in the [TCFCanada-NCLC Equivalency](#tcfcanada-nclc-equivalency) section.
3. Meet all of the requirements in the instructions for that round<br><br>

#### TCFCanada-NCLC Equivalency
TCFCanada is one of the French-language exam used by IRCC to evaluate candidates' French-language proficiency. According to [IRCC's official document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility/language-results.html), the TCFCanada-NCLC Equivalency is as follows:
